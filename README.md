# JSALStats - Twitter Bot

[I still refuse to call it X like what. Anyway anywhere in this paragraph links you to the bot lol](https://twitter.com/jsalstats)

# Requirements
* Bun
* YouTube API Key
* Twitter API Keys
* (OPTIONAL) Discord Webhooks to get alerts (about the bot, not updates just yet)

# What's new?
The old version of JSALStats ended in 2022 because turns out nothing in life is free. Regardless, in the last year, I've learnt a lot more about programming and decided to use that new knowledge to improve my old projects, starting with JSALStats and writing it in TypeScript and Bun!

This bot no longer uses estimations and makes a tweet every hour. It sounded good at the time, but I think that API updates are certainly more informative and useful and can now finally track **ALL** channels instead of a select few. There will be more I want to add to the bot that I've wanted to do since 2021, but one issue at a time :P

# Changelog
## Version 6.0 (06/05/2024)
- Re-released the Twitter bot
- Tweets API updates only for all channels
- Written in TypeScript and uses Bun
